# rawtest
trying to serve HTML pages directly from the repo

It can’t be done using raw in the URL: https://github.com/gimsieke/rawtest/raw/main/test.html will display the page’s source code.

But it’s now relatively easy to  set up Github pages that use the main (or another) branch as source, and then we can have a look at actually rendered pages at https://gimsieke.github.io/rawtest/test.html
